<p> This code is like a poetic cupid: it finds rhymes for any words you want! It uses the pronouncing library to find other words that rhyme with the given word, and suggests a random rhyme among those found. If it doesn't find any rhymes, he's also kind and says he couldn't find anything. In a very rhyming way: he's your friend who, when the rhyme fails, makes a cafun√©! </p>

>> <h3> How install </h3>

```
pip install pySoundLike

```

>> <h3> How Works </h3>

```
from pySoundLike import rhyme

print(rhyme('love'))

```
